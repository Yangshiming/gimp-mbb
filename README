MBB plugin for The GIMP
Copyright (C) 2013 Saulo A. Pessoa <saulopessoa@gmail.com>
==========================================

This is a plugin for GIMP which implements a multi-band blending technique. Conceptually speaking, this technique blends images using a different weighting function for each frequency band. It has the benefit of producing more natural transitions between images boundaries than the usual alpha blending technique.

Features/Restrictions
==========================================
* Blends two images according to mask.
* The images and the mask must be in separated layers with equal size.
* A new layer is created with the final result.
* By default, blending is performed for the whole image.
* If part of the image is selected, blending is restricted to this part.

Changes
==========================================
Current version:
0.1 (2014-04-20)
* Initial release.

Installation
==========================================
1. Type 'make' to build the plugin
2. Type 'make install' to install the plugin. By default the plugin will be installed in your GIMP user plugin directory ($HOME/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins). If you want to install the plugin system-wide, as root you must manually copy the plugin to the system GIMP plugin directory.

The plugin was tested with GIMP version 2.8.x.
